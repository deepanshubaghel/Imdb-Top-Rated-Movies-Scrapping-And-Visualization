# IMDB Top Movies Scraper and Data Analysis
This project is a Python script that scrapes the top movies data from IMDB's chart page and performs data analysis and visualization on the scraped data. The script uses the requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly libraries to scrape, clean, and visualize the data.

The script performs the following tasks:

Scrapes the top movies data from IMDB's chart page, including movie names, ratings, votings, and release years.
Cleans and prepares the scraped data for analysis by converting data types, removing missing values, and formatting the data.
Visualizes the distribution of ratings, votings, and release years using histograms and scatter plots.

The script also saves the scraped data to a CSV file for future use.

To run the script, simply execute the Python file. The script will print the status of the CSV file creation and display the visualizations.

This project can be useful for data analysis enthusiasts, students, or anyone interested in learning web scraping and data visualization using Python. The script can be modified to scrape and analyze data from other websites or to perform different types of data analysis.
